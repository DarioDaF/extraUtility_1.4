If you've ever been frustrated by dying and having to travel across half the world just to get back to farming?
Well worry no more: this mod adds the Grave Potion (sold by Witch Doctor, or crafted with a Specular Fish, any Tombstone and a Bottled water) and the Grave Mirror (crafted using any Magic Mirror and 5 Gilded Tombstones)
Use these items to teleport to your last death point and continue farming
